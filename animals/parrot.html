        <h1>Spawning</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>
            Parrots rarely spawn, with a 0.2 chance in jungle biomes. They can be found in groups of 1–2 at Y-level 70 or above. They spawn only on logs, leaves and grass blocks. <br><br>
        </p>

        <h1>Drops</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>
            When a parrot is killed, it drops:
            <ul>
                <li>1-2feathers. The maximum is increased by 1 per level of Looting, for a range of 1–5 with Looting III.</li>
                <li>1–3 when killed by a player or tamed wolf.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h1>Behavior</h1>
        <hr>
        <h3>Movement</h3>
        <p>
            Parrots are passive. They can fly, and usually fly upward if struck. They fly under normal conditions, but they can tire[1] and return to the ground. <br><br>
            Parrots crowd and settle around other nearby mobs, including neutral and hostile mobs. <br><br>
            When in water, a parrot swims by flapping its wings. <br><br>
            Like chickens, parrots flap their wings and fall slowly, preventing fall damage. <br><br>
        </p>
        
        <h3>Taming</h3>
        <p>
            Parrots can be tamed by feeding them wheat seeds, melon seeds, pumpkin seeds, or beetroot seeds, with 1⁄10 chance of success. Once tamed, interacting with a parrot makes it sit down and stand up. <br><br>
            Like tamed wolves and cats, a tamed parrot follows the player unless told to sit, and may teleport if there is a sufficient distance between them and the player. Like all tamed animals upon death, a death message is displayed to its owner. <br><br>
            Parrot teleportation is completely silent, which is intentional.[2] <br><br>
            Unlike most animals, parrots have no baby form, and cannot be bred. <br><br>
