        <h1>Spawning</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>
            Chickens spawn naturally in the Overworld in groups of 4 on grass blocks, with 2 blocks of free space above it at a light level of 9 or more. They do not spawn in desert, snowy plains, ice spikes, snowy slopes, meadows, wooded badlands, jagged peaks, frozen peaks and stony peaks. In Java Edition, chickens are more common in sparse jungles. <br><br>
            After the world generation, chickens spawn individually. <br><br>
            5% of chickens spawn as chicks. <br><br>
            In Bedrock Edition, chickens require a light level of 7 or more to spawn, and are found in groups of 2 to 4 <br><br>
        </p>

        <h1>Drops</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>
            When an adult chicken is killed, it drops: <br>
            <ul>
                <li>0–2 feathers. The maximum is increased by 1 per level of Looting, for a maximum of 0–5 with Looting III.</li>
                <li>1 raw chicken (1 cooked chicken if killed while on fire). The maximum is increased by 1 per level of Looting, for a maximum of 1–4 with Looting III.</li>
                <li>1–3xp when killed by a player or tamed wolf; (10 if it was part of a chicken jockey).</li>
            </ul>
            Chickens that were not part of chicken jockeys lay 1egg every 5 to 10 minutes. <br><br>
            When they breed, they drop 1–7xp. <br><br>
            Killing a baby chicken yields no items or experience. <br><br>
        </p>

        <h1>Behavior</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>
            Chickens are active, wandering aimlessly, chicks also following adults. When falling, they flap their wings and fall slowly, thus they are immune to fall damage. However, they avoid falling off cliffs. When harmed, they flee around. Chickens uniquely attempt to jump up to climb stairs instead of climbing them normally.[1] They are attacked by ocelots, untamed cats,‌[JE only] and foxes. Chickens follow players holding various seeds within 6 blocks. <br><br>
            While in a loaded chunk, a chicken lays an egg every 5–10 minutes (6000–12000 ticks), unless it is, or was, a part of a chicken jockey. If the player is close enough to a chicken when it lays an egg, a pop sound is heard. <br><br>
            Chickens can swim, visibly flapping their wings and staying on the water surface. While swimming, a chicken needs only one block of air above its head. If a chicken is trapped underwater for more than 15 seconds, it drowns and dies. <br><br>
