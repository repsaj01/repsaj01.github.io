        <h1>Spawning</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>
            Most pigs are adults but 5% of pigs spawn as piglet. <br><br>
        </p>
        <h3>Villages</h3>
        <p>
            In villages, pigs spawn in animal pens, stables and in butcher house backyards. <br><br>
        </p>

        <h2>Natural generation</h2>
        <h3>Java edition</h3>
        <p>
            Pigs spawn in groups of 4 above grass blocks at a light level of 9 or more in any grassy Overworld biome except in snowy plains, meadows and wooded badlands. Individuals rarely may spawn on grass after the world generation. <br><br>
        </p>
        <h3>Bedrock edition</h3>
        <p>
            Pigs spawn in groups of 1-3 above grass blocks at a light level of 7 or more in any grassy Overworld biome except in snowy tundras and wooded badlands plateaus. Individuals regularly spawn on grass after the world generation. <br><br>
        </p>

        <h1>Drops</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>
            An adult pig drops: 
            <ul>
                <li>1–3 raw porkchop or cooked porkchop if killed while on fire. The maximum amount is increased by 1 per level of Looting, for a maximum of 1-6 with Looting III.</li>
                <li>1 saddle if saddled</li>
                <li>1–3 if killed by a player or tamed wolf</li>
                <li>1–7 upon breeding</li>
            </ul>
            Killing a piglet yields no items nor experience. <br><br>
        </p>

        <h1>Behavior</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>
            Pigs oink and typically roam the Overworld in small groups avoiding hazards and cliffs high enough to cause falls. A pig flees for some seconds when harmed. <br><br>
            When a pig or piglet is struck by lightning, it transforms into a zombified piglin or baby zombified piglin, respectively. If the pig was equipped with a saddle, the saddle is lost and the player dismounts. If lightning strikes a pig in peaceful difficulty, the pig does not transform but takes normal damage from the strike. <br><br>
        </p>

        <h3>Riding</h3>
        <p>
            It is possible to ride a pig by using a saddle on it. When a saddle is used on a pig, the pig might stare at the player for a few seconds. Saddled pigs are controllable with a carrot on a stick. They start slow but accelerate to 5.20 blocks/s. Pigs can be controlled through 1-block-high bodies of water with a carrot and stick, but deeper water causes the player to dismount. Using the carrot on a stick while riding a pig makes it run faster at the cost of 7 durability. If the pig and rider fall, then fall damage is taken by the pig, without causing any knockback or slower movement speed. Piglets cannot be saddled or ridden. <br><br>
            A player can travel through a space 1 block high by riding a pig. <br><br>
