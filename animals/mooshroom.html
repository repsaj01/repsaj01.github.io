        <h1>Spawning</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>
            Red mooshrooms can spawn in mushroom fields biomes in herds of 4–8 when the light level is 9 or higher and on mycelium. They do not naturally spawn in any other biome. A red mooshroom transforms into a brown mooshroom (and vice versa) when it is struck by lightning. Brown mooshrooms never spawn naturally. <br><br>
            Red mooshrooms have a 5% chance of spawning as babies. <br><br>
        </p>

        <h1>Drops</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>
            When an adult mooshroom is killed, it drops:
            <ul>
                <li>0–2 Leather. The maximum amount is increased by 1 per level of Looting, for a maximum of 0-5 with Looting III.</li>
                <li>1–3 Raw Beef (Steak if killed while on fire). The maximum amount is increased by 1 per level of Looting, for a maximum of 1-6 with Looting III.</li>
                <li>1–3 (when killed by a player or tamed wolf)</li>
            </ul>
            Upon successful breeding, 1–7 is dropped. <br><br>
            Shearing a mooshroom drops 5 corresponding mushrooms and turns the mooshroom into a normal cow, emitting a smaller version of the explosion particle. The mushrooms don't grow back. <br><br>
            Like other baby animals, killing a baby mooshroom yields no items or experience. <br><br>
        </p>

        <h1>Behavior</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>
            Mooshrooms have the same AI behavior as cows: they walk around slowly and aimlessly, huffing and mooing occasionally. They avoid danger such as cliffs, fire, or lava, but make no attempt to stay out of water. <br><br>
            A mooshroom follows a player holding wheat. <br><br>
            A lightning strike on a mooshroom switches its color, from red to brown, or brown to red. <br><br>
        </p>

        <h3>Milking</h3>
        <p>
            A mooshroom can be milked by using a bucket on it, yielding a milk bucket. <br><br>
            Mooshrooms can also be milked using bowls to get mushroom stew. <br><br>
            When a small flower is used on a brown mooshroom, the brown mooshroom produces a suspicious stew related to that small flower the next time it is milked with a bowl. Red mooshrooms do not produce suspicious stew. The brown mooshroom returns to producing mushroom stew until fed another small flower. The small flowers produce the suspicious stew with the following effects. <br><br>
