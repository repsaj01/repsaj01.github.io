        <h1>Spawning</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>
            Ocelots spawn above grass blocks at sea level (y=63 per default) or higher in groups of 1 or 2. These are mostly adults but sometimes ocelots spawn as a kitten. When an adult ocelot spawns, there is a 1⁄7 (14.3%) chance for 2 ocelot kittens to spawn with it; this chance includes any kind of spawning, including spawning naturally, by a spawn egg, by the /summon command, or a mob spawner. <br><br>
        </p>

        <h3>Java edition</h3>
        <p>
            There is a 1⁄3 chance for a spawn attempt to fail in jungles, and spawning always fails in bamboo jungles or sparse jungles. While ocelots are passive mobs and part of the passive mob cap, they cannot spawn at all on Peaceful difficulty.[2] <br><br>
        </p>

        <h3>Bedrock Edition</h3>
        <p>
            Ocelots are found in all kinds of jungles. <br><br>
        </p>

        <h1>Drops</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>
            Upon death, adult ocelots drop 1–3 when killed by a player or tamed wolf. <br><br>
            Upon successful breeding, 1–7 is dropped. <br><br>
            Like other baby animals, killing a baby ocelot yields no experience. <br><br>
        </p>

        <h1>Behavior</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>
            Ocelots attack chickens and baby turtles. They sneak and stalk their prey before chasing it down. They can kill through a fence or a door if they are against it. <br><br>
            Creepers stay 6 blocks away from an ocelot. A creeper within this range that has begun its detonation does not flee unless the player leaves its blast radius. <br><br>
            Phantoms stay 16 blocks away from an ocelot.‌[BE only] <br><br>
            Ocelots are immune to fall damage, but still avoid falls. <br><br>
            With the exception of a faster movement rate, kittens have the same behavior as adults. <br><br>
        </p>

        <h3>Trust</h3>
        <p>
            Ocelots are one of the few mobs that can sprint, and sprint away from nearby players in Survival or Adventure mode. <br><br>
            Ocelots approach players holding raw cod or raw salmon within 10 blocks. If the player moves, turns their head too quickly, or stops holding the item while within 6 blocks, the ocelot flees and does not attempt to approach the player for a few seconds. <br><br>
            A player gains an ocelot's trust by feeding it raw cod or salmon until heart particles show, causing it to no longer flee from players. Each food item has a 1⁄3 chance of gaining the ocelot's trust. <br><br>
            Ocelots that are trusting do not despawn; otherwise, they may despawn when far enough from a player, similar to hostile mobs. <br><br>
