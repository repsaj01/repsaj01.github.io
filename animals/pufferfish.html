        <h1>Spawning</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>
            In Java Edition, pufferfish spawn in groups of 1-3 in warm, lukewarm and deep lukewarm ocean biomes, subject to fish spawning requirements. If trying to spawn inside a waterlogged solid block, the pufferfish uses the bigger "puffed" size to determine if it collides with anything solid. <br><br>
            In Bedrock Edition, fish spawn underwater at around 12–32 blocks away from the player in groups of 3–5 in warm ocean biomes, and only on the surface; that is, there must not be a spawnable block above the spawn location with a non-solid block on top. <br><br>
        </p>

        <h1>Drops</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>
            Pufferfish drop 1 of their item form when killed:
            <ul>
                <li>1 pufferfish</li>
                <li>1 bone meal (5% chance)</li>
                <li>1 - 2 bones (25% chance)</li>
                <li>1 - 3 exp when killed by a player or tamed wolf.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h1>Behavior</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>
            Pufferfish inflate themselves when approached by the player, most mobs, ‌[JE only] and armor stands.[1] <br><br>
            The player may collect a fish by using a water bucket on it, giving the player a bucket of pufferfish. Fish placed with buckets do not despawn naturally. When that fish bucket is used against a block, it empties the bucket, placing water with that fish swimming in it. An empty bucket may be used as well.‌[Bedrock Edition only] <br><br>
            Unlike other fish, pufferfish don't swim in schools. <br><br>
        </p>

        <h3>Weaknesses</h3>
        <p>
            Like other fish, pufferfish cannot survive out of water. Outside of water, they flop around like guardians for a while until they start suffocating, and then die like squid. In Bedrock Edition they rotate when flopping. Fish cannot swim or breathe in cauldron water.[2] <br><br>
            All fish are vulnerable to weapons that have the Impaling enchantment, which also affects squid, turtles, guardians, elder guardians, and dolphins. <br><br>
        </p>
        <h3>Defenses</h3>
        <p>
            A pufferfish inflates when approached by a player in Survival or Adventure mode, a drowned, an axolotl, or any non-water mob within a 5×5×5 volume around the fish, going from unpuffed, then semi-puffed, to fully puffed. Pufferfish are technically passive mobs but going near one when semi-puffed or fully puffed inflicts the player/mob with three or six seconds of Poison based on the inflation level, and touching one in its puffed or semi-puffed form deals damage separate from the poison. <br><br>
            Pufferfish also instantly inflate to their fullest form after taking any kind of damage.‌[Bedrock Edition only] After inflating, they slowly deflate to their normal shape as long as a threat is out of range. If the player/mob leaves the radius while pufferfish is in its semi-puffed stage, it deflates back to normal. <br><br>
            Undead mobs are unaffected by the poison effect, but still take damage when they come into contact with pufferfish. <br><br>
            A pufferfish inflicting damage to a mob other than creeper and ghast via touching provokes that mob to retaliate. <br><br>
            In Peaceful difficulty, pufferfish do not inflict damage or poison to player. <br><br>
