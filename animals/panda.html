        <h1>Spawning</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>
            Pandas spawn rarely, in groups of 1–2 in jungle biomes at the surface on grass blocks with at least two-block space above them at a light level of 9 or more. They are a bit more common in bamboo jungles. <br><br>
            Pandas spawn with a randomized personality, with the normal one being the most common and the brown variant being the rarest. <br><br>
            5% of pandas spawn as babies. <br><br>
        </p>

        <h1>Drops</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>
            Upon death, adult pandas drop:
            <ul>
                <li>1 bamboo</li>
                <li>0-2 bamboo, increased 1 per level by looting</li>
                <li>1 - 3 exp, if killed by a tamed wolf or the player</li>
            </ul>
            Baby pandas have 1/700 chance to drop 1 slimeball after they sneeze. <br><br>
            Upon successful breeding, 1–7 is dropped. <br><br>
            Like other baby animals, killing a baby panda yields no items or experience. <br><br>
        </p>

        <h1>Behavior</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>
            Pandas act similarly to other neutral mobs; they attack when hurt, but only once (similar to llamas, and bees). Pandas do not attack on Peaceful difficulty. They also move faster in water than other land mobs (similar to polar bears). Pandas follow any player who is carrying bamboo and stop following if the player moves beyond approximately 16 blocks away. They also whimper if a thunderstorm is happening in the area. Adult pandas seek out bamboo and cake to eat. <br><br>
            Baby pandas have a 1⁄6000 chance (0.01666%; for weak baby panda is 1⁄500 (0.2%) chance) of sneezing every tick , which rarely drops a slime ball and make all adult pandas jump within 10 blocks of the sneezing baby panda. They also occasionally roll over and jump around. <br><br>
            Pandas have one private inventory. <br><br>
            Pandas can be ridden by baby zombie variants.‌[Bedrock Edition only] <br><br>
            If a panda is being attacked by a player near a villager, that villager displays angry particles.‌[Java Edition only] However, it does not affect the popularity of the player. <br><br>
        </p>

        <h1>Genetics</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>
            Each panda has two hidden values called "genes" or "alleles", similar to biology. There is the main gene and a hidden gene. Normal, aggressive, lazy, worried, and playful personalities are dominant traits, and weak and brown personalities are recessive traits. A dominant trait always has priority over a recessive trait. If both the main and hidden genes are dominant, the main gene has priority and presents itself as the panda's personality. Being recessive, weak and brown personalities occur if both the main and hidden genes of a panda are recessive genes. However, if the main gene is recessive and the hidden gene is not the same gene, then a normal personality results. To get a brown or weak panda, both the main and hidden genes must be both brown or weak. <br><br>
            When two pandas breed, each one passes one of their genes to their children, who then randomly mix both obtained genes as their respective main and hidden genes. There is also a 1⁄32 chance for each gene of the baby to mutate into another gene. Mutations have different probabilities to mutate into the different genes, these probabilities can be found in the table underneath. These mutation probabilities also apply to spawned (not bred) pandas for their main and hidden genes. <br><br>
