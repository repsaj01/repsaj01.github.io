        <h1>Spawning</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>
            Dolphins are found in groups (pods) of 3–5 in all ocean biomes, except frozen oceans and cold oceans. They spawn exclusively between levels 50 and 64. Dolphins continuously spawn as long as their spawn requirements are met, and naturally despawn if no players are near by, similar to squid. <br><br>
            10% of dolphins spawn as babies.‌[Bedrock Edition only] <br><br>
        </p>

        <h1>Drops</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>
            When killed, dolphins drop 0–1 raw cod (cooked cod if on fire). <br> The maximum amount is increased by 1 per level of Looting, for a maximum of 0–4 with Looting III. 1–3 are dropped as well. <br><br>
        </p>

        <h1>Behavior</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>
            Dolphins normally swim in pods, occasionally leaping out of the water to get air. They are also able to jump from one body of water to another. Additionally, they chase after players in boats. <br><br>
            Players who sprint swim within a 9 block spherical radius of a dolphin receive Dolphin's Grace for 5 seconds‌[JE only]. Players with Invisibility do not receive the effect unless they already had Dolphin's Grace before receiving Invisibility, or if they are wearing armor. In Bedrock Edition, the player simply gets a speed boost without a status effect. <br><br>
            Dolphins are lured by dropped items that are inside nearby water blocks, knocking them around and chasing them. If the dolphin can not find a path to a dropped item, the dolphin may stay underwater to the point of drowning. If the dolphin is in, or on, a waterlogged bottom slab or chest with an air block above, the dolphin is prevented from drowning. <br><br>
            Should the player or another mob hit a dolphin (unless the dolphin is killed within one hit‌[Java Edition only]), the whole pod retaliates, attacking all at once similar to wolves and zombified piglins. Hostile dolphins remain hostile even if they are fed fish. <br><br>
            Feeding dolphins raw cod or raw salmon improves their "trust" and interactions with the player, depending on the amount of fish fed. <br><br>
            When dolphins are fed raw cod or raw salmon, they swim to the nearest shipwreck, buried treasure, or ocean ruins. Because they are locating the chest in the structures rather than the structures themselves, breaking the chests causes the dolphin to locate a new structure with intact chests. Dolphins also avoid guardians and elder guardians. <br><br>
        </p>

        <h3>Weaknesses</h3>
        <p>
            If a dolphin leaves the water in dry weather, it starts taking suffocation damage after two minutes, and eventually dies. It takes no damage out of water during rain. Regardless of weather, a dolphin on land actively seeks out a body of water, or seeks its target if in a hostile state. <br><br>
            They cannot survive without getting air every once in a while, so if they stay submerged for about four minutes they begin drowning. The water breathing effect prevents them from drowning. <br><br>
            Dolphins cannot ride boats, similarly to squid and all types of fish. <br><br>
            Dolphins can be towed by a lead. <br><br>
            Because the dolphin is an aquatic mob, they are affected by the Impaling enchantment.‌[Java Edition only] <br><br>
