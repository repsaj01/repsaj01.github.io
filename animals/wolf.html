        <h1>Spawning</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>
            Wolves spawn naturally above grass blocks, dirt, coarse dirt, snow blocks or podzol in forests, taigas, groves, old growth taigas and snowy taigas, along with all variants of these biomes (with the exception of flower forests), in packs of 4, where 10% spawn as pups. <br><br>
            Naturally-spawned wolves are untamed and become hostile if attacked by the player. <br><br>
        </p>

        <h1>Drops</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>
            Adult wolves drop 1–3 experience orbs when killed by a player or tamed wolf. A tamed wolf that is killed by its owner still drops experience. <br><br>
            Upon successful breeding, 1–7 are dropped. <br><br>
            Like other baby animals, killing a pup yields no experience. <br><br>
        </p>

        <h1>Behavior and appearance</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>
            Wolves exhibit three different states depending on how the user interacts with them:
            <ul>
                <li>Untamed wolves have gray fur, a drooping tail, and their eyes consist of a white pixel and a black pixel for the pupil (on each side). They are neutral toward the player and hostile toward sheep, rabbits, foxes, baby turtles, and skeletons. They avoid llamas, although wolves may attack a llama that spits on them. They do not despawn, even if they are in an unloaded chunk, or 32 blocks away from the player.</li>
                <li>Angry wolves are characterized by their constant growling and fearsome appearance. Wild wolves become hostile when they are either attacked by a player or mob, if not killed in one hit‌[JE only], or when they see a mob they want to eat. Their tail is held out straight, their eyes become blood red, their mouth is raised in a slight snarl, and they have angry eyebrows. Angry wolves are hostile only to mobs that attack them, or to the mobs they are hunting. They can see attackers even if they are under the invisibility effect, but they cannot track the attacker down, if they get out of their render distance, or the attacker was able to unload the chunk where the wolves were. Angry wolves cannot be leashed, but a wild wolf may become angry while it is still leashed without dropping the lead.</li>
                <li>Tamed wolves have friendlier looking eyes. They have a default red collar around their neck, which can be dyed using any color of dye on the wolf. This also includes other wolves owned by other player, where any player can dye that wolf's collar. Pressing use on the wolf makes it sit and remain in place and not follow the player around. Tamed wolves that are not sitting attack players or mobs that their owner attacks, or those that injure their owner unless the target has the same owner or is on the same team. They do not attack creepers, ghasts, tamed horses or tamed cats, regardless of owner. Standing tamed wolves attack only skeletons and their variants without provocation. Tamed wolves are always passive to the player, even if the player hits them or kills a tamed wolf on the same team.</li>
            </ul>
            A wolf becomes hostile to a player or other mob that attacks it unless the attacker is the wolf's owner, or is otherwise on the same team, or if killed in one hit‌[JE only]. It also causes wild wolves and standing tamed wolves in a 33×33×21 cuboid centered on the attacked wolf to become hostile to the attacker, allowing coordination for attacks and team hunts (only in wild wolves). <br><br>
            In Java Edition, any tamed wolf attacked by a player/mob causes all standing wolves on that team to attack that player/mob who attacked the tamed wolf. <br><br>
            Skeletons and their variants, foxes, baby turtles and passive rabbits actively avoid both tamed and wild wolves. Killer rabbits‌[JE only] attack wolves actively. Sheep ignore wolves, but flee when attacked by one. Sheep do not ignore tamed wolves nor flee from them. <br><br>
            When a player within 8 blocks holds meat or bones near a wolf, the wolf tilts its head as if to 'beg' for the food for 2 to 4 seconds. <br><br>
            The behavior of pups is the same as tamed wolves. Pups have larger heads, similar to other animal babies. <br><br>
            Wolves are 0.85‌[JE only] or 0.8‌[BE only] blocks tall and pups are 0.425‌[JE only] or 0.4‌[BE only] blocks tall. The textures of the wolves are tinted dark gray once submerged in water. <br><br>
            In peaceful difficulty, hostile wolves deal no damage to the player. <br><br>
