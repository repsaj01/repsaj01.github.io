        <h1>Spawning</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>
            The majority of sheep are white, with an 81.836% chance of spawning. The light gray, gray and black sheep each have a 5% chance of spawning, or a 15% chance collectively. Brown sheep have an uncommon 3% chance to spawn. Pink sheep have a rare chance of 0.164% of spawning naturally. <br><br>
            If a sheep spawner is placed via /setblock, the sheep model spinning inside appears with one of the six naturally spawning colors. Independently from the displayed color, all six variants are able to spawn, the usual chances apply. To guarantee that sheep always spawn with the desired color, additional NBT tags can be applied to the spawner, utilizing the Color tag. <br><br>
        </p>

        <h3>Natural generation</h3>
        <p>
            In Java Edition, 4 sheep may spawn above grass blocks, at a light level of 9 or higher, even on snowy taigas. <br><br>
            In Bedrock Edition, 2 to 3 sheep spawn during the world generation on grass blocks at the surface at a light level of 7 or higher with at least a 2 block space above, except in snowy taigas, snowy plains, ice spikes or wooded badlands. They later spawn individually on grassy biomes. 5% spawn as baby sheep. <br><br>
            Two sheep sometimes spawn in shepherd houses, butcher houses and animal pens in villages. <br><br>
        </p>

        <h1>Drops</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>
            An adult sheep drops:
            <ul>
                <li>1 wool of the corresponding color. Sheep that have not regrown their wool do not drop wool.</li>
                <li>1–2 raw mutton (cooked mutton if killed while on fire or when in water using a sword with fire aspect). The maximum amount is increased by 1 per level of Looting, for a maximum of 1–5 with Looting III.</li>
                <li>1–3 experience orbs if killed by a player or tamed wolf.</li>
            </ul>
            When sheared, sheep give 1–3 wool and do not take any damage. <br><br>
            Upon successful breeding, 1–7 is dropped. <br><br>
            Killing a baby sheep yields no items nor experience. <br><br>
        </p>

        <h1>Behavior</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>
            Sheep wander aimlessly and individually or in small flocks of two to four. Sheep avoid cliffs and hazardous areas if it warrants damage. Sheep emit hoarse bleats in mostly random patterns and especially when attacked. If harmed, sheep flee for a few seconds, but make no special attempt to avoid wolves. <br><br>
            Sheep are nonchalant to players or other mobs, but follow a player holding wheat within a six blocks radius. <br><br>
            Adult sheep cannot fit through a gap if the 90-degree intersection of two fences is removed whereas the player and most other mobs can get through easily. <br><br>
            Sheep graze grass blocks, changing them into dirt blocks. In Bedrock Edition, they can also eat the grass or fern on a block, making it disappear. Baby sheep graze grass much more often than adults. Sheep can eat grass through blocks that are less than a full block thick, including extremities such as honey blocks, as well as from inside minecarts. A sheared sheep regrows its wool after grazing. Therefore, if no grass is available, a sheep cannot regrow its wool after being sheared. If an adult sheep has the opportunity, the chance of eating grass is 1⁄1000 per game tick (1⁄50 for baby sheep). If /gamerule mobGriefing is set to false, grass blocks remain, but the sheep still regrow their wool.[1] <br><br>
        </p>

        <h1>Easter eggs</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>
            An evoker can also change a sheep's wool color if the evoker isn't engaged in combat and /gamerule mobGriefing is set to true. Then it can change the wool color of any blue sheep within 16 blocks to red. It signals the spell by producing orange color particles () and making a "wololo" sound. This is a reference or easter egg to the priest unit of the 1997 game Age of Empires. <br><br>
            If a sheep is named jeb_, its wool cycles with interpolation through all dye colors in a similar manner to prismarine. This is purely a visual effect. A sheep named jeb_ can still be dyed without changing the rainbow effect, and any wool obtained from one of these sheep has the most recent color as if the sheep was not named. <br><br>
