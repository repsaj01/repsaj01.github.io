        <h1>Spawning</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>
            Llamas spawn at light level 7 or above. They naturally spawn only above grass blocks in savanna plateau / savanna‌[BE only] biomes in herds of 4 llamas and in windswept hills biomes in herds of 4 to 6 llamas. They come in four variants of coat colors: brown, cream, white, gray. Wandering traders always spawn with two leashed trader llamas. <br><br>
            10% of llamas spawn as babies. <br><br>
            In Bedrock Edition, there is no spawn egg for trader llamas.‌[until BE 1.19.10] They always spawn when a wandering trader is spawned using a spawn egg or by using the /summon command, although a trader llama can be summoned using /summon llama ~ ~ ~ minecraft:from_wandering_trader. <br><br>
        </p>

        <h1>Drops</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>
            When killed, adult llamas drop:
            <ul>
                <li>0-2 leather (up to 0-5 with Looting 3).</li>
                <li>Any equipped carpets and chest.</li>
                <li>All items in their inventory.</li>
                <li>1–3, only if killed by a tamed wolf or the player.</li>
            </ul>
            Upon successful breeding, 1–7 is dropped. <br><br>
            Like other baby animals, killing a baby llama yields no item or experience. <br><br>
        </p>

        <h1>Usage</h1>
        <hr>
        <h3>Leading</h3>
        <p>
            Llamas do not accept saddles, so the player cannot control its movement, even when tamed. Leads are the best way to move llamas. Leading a llama actually signals all other llamas not already in a caravan nearby (up to nine) to follow each other, forming a caravan of up to ten llamas. Leashing a second llama forms a caravan of ten more llamas, and there is no intentional limit on the number of llamas following a player. <br><br>
        </p>
        <h3>Storage</h3>
        <p>
            A llama can be equipped with a chest by right clicking a chest on it once tamed, giving it 3, 6, 9, 12, or 15 slots of inventory space, scaling directly with its Strength NBT (see § Data values below). Once equipped, the chest cannot be retrieved without killing the llama and can be accessed by shift + right clicking the llama. A llama's potential carry capacity is a number of item slots equal to 3*Strength, with a maximum of 15 spaces. <br><br>
        </p>
        <h3>Decoration</h3>
        <p>
            Llamas can be equipped with carpets in their carpet slot (). Each carpet color shows as a different patterned rug on the llama's back. This can be useful for color-coding their storage, similar to dyed shulker boxes. <br><br>
            For the purposes of the /item command, a llama carries its carpet in the horse.armor slot. <br><br>
            Trader llamas that do not have a carpet wear a blue rug design. It can be replaced with a carpet but not removed. When given carpets, both types of llama look the same. <br><br>
            A llama's carpet decoration remains visible when the llama is under the effect of Invisibility. <br><br>
        </p>

        <h1>Behavior</h1>
        <hr>
        <h3>Spitting</h3>
        <p>
            Llamas are neutral, but if a player or mob attacks one, it spits at the attacker once to deal 1♥ damage. Sometimes their spit can miss their target and hit another llama, starting a fight within a group of llamas. Additionally, a wandering trader's llamas spit at mobs or players who attack the wandering trader. <br><br>
            Llamas are hostile toward wolves and spit without provocation, but they don't attack tamed wolves unless provoked. Wolves are fearful of llamas of strength 4 or 5 and always run away, similar to zombies and villagers.[1] Wolves flee from weaker llamas less often. <br><br>
            Despite the spitting being a projectile, dying from llama spit still shows the death message "< player > was slain by Trader Llama/Llama." <br><br>
            Trader llamas are hostile toward all zombie variants and illagers,‌[Java Edition only] and they defend both themselves and their wandering trader. <br><br>
            The spit entity must belong to a llama to do damage, meaning that the spit summoned by commands does no damage. Llama spit can be deflected if hit by the player.‌[Bedrock Edition only] <br><br>
            Llamas do not attack a player/mob if they attacked another llama. <br><br>
        </p>

        <h3>Taming</h3>
        <p>
            Llamas can be tamed by repetitively riding them until hearts are displayed, done by pressing use on the llama while holding nothing. <br><br>
            Taming success depends on the llama's Temper NBT. Temper is a positive trait, with higher values increasing the chance of successful taming. Llamas begin with a Temper value of 0 and a maximum of 100. When a player rides an untamed llama, a random number from 0 to 99 is chosen. The llama gets tamed successfully if this number is less than the Temper value, otherwise, the Temper is increased by 5 and the player is bucked off. Temper can also be increased by feeding the llama. <br><br>
            Unlike any other tamed animal, tamed llamas can still retaliate at players should the player hit them. <br> <br>
            If a player kills a wandering trader and stays away from the trader llamas for a while, the llamas are tame when the player rides it, and the player can place carpets on the llama. <br><br>
            Naturally spawned trader llamas are untamed and cannot be ridden while being led by their wandering trader. If unleashed, they become tamable‌[Java Edition only] or tamed.‌[Bedrock Edition only] <br><br>
            In Java Edition, tamed trader llamas do not despawn. <br><br>
            Like all tame animals, a death message is displayed to a tamed llama's owner if it is killed. <br><br>
            Tamed llamas do not spit at mobs that attack its owner, although it spits at any mob that attacks the llama. <br><br>
