        <h1>Spawning</h1>
        <hr>
        <h3>Natural generation</h3>
        <p>
            Cows spawn in small herds above grass blocks. However, their spawn rate varies per biome. Most cows spawn as adults, but they have a 5% chance of spawning as a calf, or baby cow. <br><br>
            In Bedrock Edition, herds of 2 to 3 cows spawn in grass blocks at a light level of 9 or higher with at least 2 blocks of space above, except in snowy taigas, snowy plains, meadows, mangrove swamps and wooded badlands. Cows commonly spawn individually above grass after world generation. <br><br>
            In Java Edition, herds of 4 cows spawn on grass blocks at a light level of 7 or higher with at least 2 blocks of space above, except in snowy plains, meadows, mangrove swamps and wooded badlands. Cows rarely spawn individually above grass after world generation. <br><br>
        </p>
        <h3>Villages</h3>
        <p>
            A cow sometimes spawns inside animal pens and butchers' houses in villages. <br><br>
        </p>
        <h3>Mooshrooms</h3>
        <p>
            Shearing a mooshroom turns it into a cow and drops 5 mushrooms corresponding to the type of mooshroom. <br><br>
        </p>

        <h1>Drops</h1>
        <p>
            Adult cows drop:
            <ul>
                <li>0–2 leather. The maximum amount is increased by 1 per level of Looting, for a maximum of 5 with Looting III.</li>
                <li>1–3 raw beef (or steak if killed while on fire). The maximum amount is increased by 1 per level of Looting, for a maximum of 6 with Looting III.</li>
                <li>1–3 experience orbs are dropped when killed by a player or tamed wolf.</li>
                <li>1–7 experience orbs upon successful breeding.</li>
            </ul>
            Killing a calf yields no items nor experience. <br><br>
        </p>

        <h1>Behavior</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>
            A cow wanders around aimlessly, mooing and huffing in small herds occasionally. A cow quickly flees for a few seconds when harmed. Additionally, cows tend to:
            <ul>
                <li>go to lit and grassy places.</li>
                <li>sometimes look at players within eight horizontal and four vertical blocks for two to four seconds.</li>
                <li>avoid going to water unless they are following players and always avoid traversing minecart rails and walking off cliffs high enough to cause fall damage.</li>
                <li>avoid environmental hazards, such as fire, lava, cactus, sweet berry bushes or dripstone, but make no attempts to avoid explosions.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>cows can step on pressure plates, jump on dripleaves or farmland and climb ladders, stairs, vines and cave vines.</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
        </p><br>

        <h3>Milking</h3>
        <p>
            An adult cow can be milked by using a bucket on it, yielding a milk bucket.
